You don't need to manually download the data for this. I used the opendatsets library to download and read the data directly from Kaggle as it was over 100mb in size and github was not letting me upload it. You are gonna need my Kaggle api key so, I will mention them at the end. 
Kaggle API-{"username":"devank07","key":"fdfaa58e17243c92de872efef150afc6"} 
alternate Kaggle API-{"username":"sandeepkumar69","key":"05fdbf76c44d03fb6c1eae260b81451b"}
